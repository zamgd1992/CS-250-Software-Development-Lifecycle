# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs are the problems a program is trying to solve. Writing "user stories" creates a template to make it easier to express these problems. a "user story" should only explain what a user of teh program would like it to do not the implementation of the solution. Keeping a user story more open ended allows the developer to find a creative solution for the problem. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I have enjoyed learning about agile approaches to software development. Up to this point I have really only developed code on my own which makes finding creative solutions easier. This can become more complex when developing as a team because your part of the program needs to work with the rest of the program but it is still necessary to find creative solutions. An agile approach allows for creativity to strive by having an environment where teams can work constructively together without as much pressure to get things done in unreasonable amounts of time. An agile mindset is something that I continue to develop now, and throughout my career.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Agile focuses on what you give to the customer which can put more ownership to the product. This makes you put your best work forward. Agile also looks at continued improvement. These are both important when working as a team. You want to do the most you can to help your team. Part of that is improving yourself but also, helping your team improve. This is done by helping others on the team as well as improving how the team works together. Ultimately, being a good team member is upholding your responsibilities and helping others with theirs.
